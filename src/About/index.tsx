        <p>I'm a creative person that's driven by desires.
        I love art, poerty and technology, learning and teaching is a passion.
        And every star is a possibility, harvested and visualized inside my mind.</p>

        <q>Dreamers are <b>Visionaries</b> of a future untold,
        and while the <b>Creative</b> seek nothing but truth,
        the <b>Creators</b> are masters of destruction!</q>
